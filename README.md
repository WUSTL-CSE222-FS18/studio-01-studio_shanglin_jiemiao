# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***
##### Answer:
Designing a product that students can entertain themselves when they walk to the school.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***
##### Answer:
| Feature   |      Description      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| light Weight|  When students walk to the campus, it is difficult to carry heavy stuff  |
| Safety |    When students are playing games, safety is the also important   |
| affordable | This product is not a necessity for students, so we have to design it in a cheap way |

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***
##### Answer:
###### Solution:
 - Our product is a pair of augmented reality glasses, which you are able to chat with friends, watch movies, and play video games when walking to the school.

| Strengths   |      Weakness      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| It is transplant, so students can notice their surroundings  |  Students will feel dizzy when the time of playing is too long |
| It is easy to use because it is built with artificial intelligence |  When students are really into the game, thy safety will be a concern. |    |



## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

##### Answer:
- The idea is very unique
- The Weakness of our design may be a little bit challenge to overcome


(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***
##### Answer:
- Our product will send you a warning when the estimated time is beyond the safety time.
- Our product is designed to change the lightness to avoid dizziness.
- Our product can warn you when you are off road.
## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***
1. Enjoyment
2. Attraction
3. Creativity

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***
##### Answer:
Although our product can improve the experience when students are walking to the school, the safety concern is difficult to be solved.

Yes, it can have a lot of other functions such as taking classes, doing labs, and etc, when we have a fund raising.

***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***
##### Answer:

Yes, students are satisfied with these functions we designed. However, it is difficult to fulfill all the functions.
(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
- Things
- Services
- Feedback
- Human Actions
- Missions

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***
